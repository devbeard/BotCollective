# BotCollective

A collection of bots and logic apps I have created to act as automated personalities in Slack, Github and so on. Gradually moving these from internal git repos to open source.

(Thanks to HÃ¥kon for pushing me on this.)

## BirthdayBot

An ASP.NET MVC app (created before the glorious days of .NET Core) that can check an Azure storage table for people to congratulate with their birthday Monday-Sunday, congratulate people on Friday if they have upcoming days in Sat or Sun, alert managers if any anniversaries (20,30,40,50 and so on) are upcoming and present a simple admin user interface.

Clearly not very robust or generalized for others uses (it even has the text in Norwegian), but a start. Pull requests very welcome.

## Other bots

These are some other bots I will try to move to this repository:

 * JokeBot - get a random Norwegian joke
 * YrBot - what is the forecast for this afternoon for my path home
 * BergenKinoBot - what movies are playing right now at Bergen Kino
 * GithubEnterpriseBot - alerts about new PRs for me and can give me stats for waiting PRs
 * BloodBot - the most emo s#*! throwing, miserable quote spewing automaton you will ever encounter... only install if you are way to chipper
